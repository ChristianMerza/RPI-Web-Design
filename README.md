# RPI-Web-Design
A Raspberry Pi is a small computer that uses an ARM 11 processor running at 700MHz with 512MB RAM.

Setting up a Raspberry Pi as a home web server is
a great way to learn about web design and server administration.
A Raspberry Pi uses much less power than a PC, and takes up much less space.
The fully featured Linux operating system comes with lots of software, 
including the Apache web server which is used to host some of the world's biggest web sites.
